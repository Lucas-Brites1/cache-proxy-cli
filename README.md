# Cache  Proxy  Server

A  Cache  Proxy  Server  written  in  TypeScript,  using  [Node.js](https://node.js/?form=MG0AV3).  This  server  helps  to  efficiently  cache  API  responses,  improving  performance  and  reducing  load  on  external  services.

## Using Redis

This  project  offers  the  flexibility  to  use  either  Redis  or  Node-Cache  for  caching.

**When  choosing  to  run  the  program  with  Redis,  it  requires  a  bit  more  setup  as  you  will  need  to  configure  the  Redis  server  on  your  local  machine.  The  advantages  of  using  Redis  are  that  it  simulates  a  cache  that  does  not  reset  its  information  after  execution  ends.  In  contrast,  if  you  choose  Node-Cache,  no  additional  installations  are  needed,  but  the  information  will  not  persist  after  the  execution  finishes.**


### Option  1:  Using  Redis
*If you prefer to use Node-Cache, simply skip the Redis setup, and the server will automatically fall back to using it.*


To  use  Redis  as  persistent  cache  for  this  server,  follow  these  steps:

1.  **Install  Redis**:  You  can  download  and  install  Redis  from  the  official  [Redis website](https://redis.io/?form=MG0AV3).
    
2.  **Start  Redis  Server**:  After  installation,  start  the  Redis  server  by  running:
    
   
    

    
    ``` bash
    redis-server
    
    ```
    
3.  **Ensure  Redis  is  Running  Correctly**:  Execute  the  following  command:
    
 
    
    
    ``` bash
    redis-cli ping
    
    ```
    
    If  Redis  is  running,  it  should  respond  with  `PONG`.
    
4.  **Set  Environment  Variables**:  Go  to  the  `.env`  file  in  the  project  and  replace  the  placeholders  `<your_redis_ip_here>`  and  `<your_redis_port_here>`  with  your  Redis  server's  IP  address  and  port  number,  respectively.
    
    -   If  you  are  running  Redis  locally,  the  default  IP  address  is  `127.0.0.1`  and  the  default  port  is  `6379`.
        
    -   If  you  are  using  a  remote  Redis  server,  consult  your  service  provider's  documentation  or  management  interface  to  obtain  the  correct  IP  address  and  port.
        

## Running the Server

***If  you  choose  Redis  as  cache  manager  for  testing  this  project,  follow  the  steps  ahead:***

1.  **Running  the  Server**:
    ***REDIS***

	 	   
    ```bash
    yarn start -- CACHE-REDIS -p <port_number> -u <url_to_fetch_information>
    ```
    
    After  that,  you  just  need  to  open  your  localhost  at  the  port  you  specified.  For  example:
    
   
	     
    ```bash
    yarn start -- CACHE-REDIS -p 3333 -u https://dummyjson.com/test
    ```

3. **Clear Cache**:
   1. Clear all cache:

   ```bash
   yarn start -- CLEAR-REDIS
   ```

   2. Clear a specific key:
  
   ```bash
   yarn start -- CLEAR-REDIS -k <url_to_clear>
   ```

***If  you  choose  Node Cache  as  cache  manager  for  testing  this  project,  follow  the  steps  ahead:***

1.  **Running  the  Server**:
	***NODE CACHE***

	   ```bash
	   yarn start -- CACHE-NODE -p <port_number> -u <url_to_fetch_information>
	   ```

After  that,  you  just  need  to  open  your  localhost  at  the  port  you  specified.  For  example:
	     
	   ```bash
	   yarn start -- CACHE-NODE -p 3333 -u https://dummyjson.com/test
	   ```

2. Clear a specific key:
   1. Clear all cache:
  
	   ```bash
	   yarn start -- CLEAR-NODE
	   ```

   2. Clear a specific key:
  
	   ```bash
	   yarn start -- CLEAR-NODE -k <url_to_clear>
	   ```
    
Then  check  `http://localhost:3333/`  and  see  the  logs  in  the  console.  If  you  want  to  see  the  response  from  the  API,  you  can  use  tools  like  [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/?form=MG0AV3),  [Postman](https://www.postman.com/?form=MG0AV3),  or  [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/?form=MG0AV3).
